    To merge two rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table, we use the rowspan and colspan attributes on the <td> and <th> elements.

    -Example for rowspan: 

        <html>
        <head>
        <title>Merging Rows Example</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>Heading 1</th>
                <th>Heading 2</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td rowspan="2">Merged Cell</td>
                <td>lorem</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ipsum</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>dolor</td>
                <td>sit amet</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </body>
        </html>



    -Example for colpan: 

        <html>
        <head>
        <title>Merging Columns Example</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>Heading 1</th>
                <th colspan="2">Heading 2 and 3</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>lorem</td>
                <td>ipsum</td>
                <td>dolor</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>emet</td>
            <td colspan="2">Merged Cell</td>
        </tr>
        </table>
